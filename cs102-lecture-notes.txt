git add : Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.
git commit : Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.
git clean : Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.
git clone : Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.
git status : Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. You’ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see 
             exactly what is being included in the next snapshot.
