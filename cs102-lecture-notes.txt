git add : Moves changes from the working directory to the staging area. This gives you the opportunity to prepare a snapshot before committing it to the official history.
git commit : Takes the staged snapshot and commits it to the project history. Combined with git add, this defines the basic workflow for all Git users.
git clean : Removes untracked files from the working directory. This is the logical counterpart to git reset, which (typically) only operates on tracked files.
git clone : Creates a copy of an existing Git repository. Cloning is the most common way for developers to obtain a working copy of a central repository.
git status : Displays the state of the working directory and the staged snapshot. Youâ€™ll want to run this in conjunction with git add and git commit to see 
             exactly what is being included in the next snapshot.
